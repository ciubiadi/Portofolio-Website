# My Portofolio
## App description
### Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm excited to introduce you to my digital space, a dynamic showcase that serves as both my resume and a curated collection of my work. Designed with a perfect blend of minimalism and vibrancy, my portfolio not only highlights my projects but also provides a glimpse into my skills, employment history, and overall journey in the world of technology.

### Key Features:

Dark and Light Mode: Seamlessly switch between dark and light themes to enhance your viewing experience.
Framer Motion Animations: Enjoy smooth and captivating animations powered by Framer Motion, especially crafted for scrolling through my projects and navigating the site.
Interactive Header: Watch as key information elegantly pops up in the header, creating a visually appealing introduction to my portfolio.
Design Aesthetic:
The design philosophy of my portfolio revolves around a clean, minimalistic layout with a touch of vibrancy. Striking a balance between simplicity and visual appeal, the design ensures a pleasant and engaging exploration of my professional journey.

Technological Stack:
* Built with the latest technologies, my portfolio leverages the power of:
* Next.js and React: Providing a robust and efficient framework for a seamless user experience.
* Typescript: Enhancing code quality and maintainability.
* Tailwind CSS: Delivering a responsive and stylish design.
* Context API: Managing state with efficiency.
* Framer Motion: Bringing life to the user interface through captivating animations.
* React Email, Resend: Ensuring a reliable and secure contact experience.
* Overcoming Challenges: Building this portfolio wasn't without its challenges. Overcoming limitations in Firefox and addressing display issues in Chrome are just few examples. The result is a website that not only looks great but performs flawlessly across different browsers.

### Future Plans:
I'm not stopping here. My next venture involves building the full-stack EvolVMe app, diving deeper into the functionalities of Next.js and React. Stay tuned for more exciting updates and innovative projects.

## Installation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
