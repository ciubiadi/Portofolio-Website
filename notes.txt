General NextJS project structure :
- The root of the app is in the app/layout.tsx;
- For the actual pages I am using the app/page.tsx


Prerequisites and start asumptions : 
- I will only use 1 page.
- lib folder(from library) will contain the project data such as links to the navbar, the projects, skills or experience
- react-icons
- implement with Framer Motion animations such as the animation from active item of 
navbar 

Reminders & Refreshers :
- in the data.ts, the links are exported as const( a TypeScript feature that infer automatically the types ), so 
it's telling that the strings for name and hash will not be any random strings but exactly the specified strings.
Also "as const" is making them read-only.

Header :
- because of the animation I have 1 part which is the white background and 1 part which are the nav links
- With initial and animate attributes in the motion.div, framer motion is generating
a transform and translate declarations
- the 2 animations from header are splitted into 2 motion.divs to avoid issues, so the white
background animation is separated from the gray active nav link animation
