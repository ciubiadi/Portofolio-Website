General NextJS project structure :
- The root of the app is in the app/layout.tsx;
- For the actual pages I am using the app/page.tsx


Prerequisites and start asumptions : 
- I will only use 1 page.
- lib folder(from library) will contain the project data such as links to the navbar, the projects, skills or experience
- react-icons
- implement with Framer Motion animations such as the animation from active item of 
navbar 
- clsx package for conditionally applying tailwind classNames 

Reminders & Refreshers :
- in the data.ts, the links are exported as const( a TypeScript feature that infer automatically the types ), so 
it's telling that the strings for name and hash will not be any random strings but exactly the specified strings.
Also "as const" is making them read-only.
- In NextJS, if I want to use external links, I need to add to the next.config.js the following code in order to be able to 
use hostnames of external links: 
images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "images.unsplash.com",
      },
    ],
},
- CSS Positioning : 
*)By default, the position property for all HTML elements in CSS is set to "static". 
*)"position: relative" works the same way as position: static;, but it lets you change an element's position.
hanges the position of the element relative to the parent element and relative to itself and where it would usually 
be in the regular document flow of the page. This means that it's relative to its original position within the parent element.
*) Elements with "position: absolute" are not positioned based on their usual place in the document flow, but based on the position 
of their ancestor.
- I used "scroll-mt-28 mb-28" to position properly when clicking on the nav items, so I have a margin botton and top.


Header :
- because of the animation I have 1 part which is the white background and 1 part which are the nav links
- With initial and animate attributes in the motion.div, framer motion is generating
a transform and translate declarations
- the 2 animations from header are splitted into 2 motion.divs to avoid issues, so the white
background animation is separated from the gray active nav link animation
