General NextJS project structure :
- The root of the app is in the app/layout.tsx;
- For the actual pages I am using the app/page.tsx


Prerequisites and start asumptions : 
- I will only use 1 page.
- lib folder(from library) will contain the project data such as links to the navbar, the projects, skills or experience
- react-icons
